# Week 16

## Exercise
Using the starter code provided, write a Java program that reads a list of `String`s from the user, and then uses the `map()` and `flatMap()` methods to transform the list in the following way:

1. Use the map method to transform each string in the list to a stream of characters.
2. Use the flatMap method to flatten the streams of characters into a single stream.
3. Use the sorted method to sort the characters in the stream in ascending order.
4. Use the distinct method to remove any duplicate characters from the stream.
5. Use the collect method to convert the stream to a list of characters.
6. Print the resulting list of characters to the console.
